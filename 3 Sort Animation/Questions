1.	
Two different threads are running in each sort class, one to sort the array and one to draw the animation.  
I used locks so that these methods do not change the state variables at the same time or get wrong information.  
Only one thread can alter the state variables at a time.
2.	
Sleep means the thread does not run for a certain amount of time.  
It remains in whatever state it was in when sleep is called.  
Await means the thread is not going to run until it is told to continue, 
and also if it is in a lock then it will release this lock for other threads to use. 
3.	
This creates a deadlock because the thread that await() was called on had the lock, 
and now it is unlocking it for another thread to use but the other threads will only 
know it is unlocked if sigal() or signallAll() is called.
